# discordCONSOLE
Simple discord.js commando bot that allows chatting with others via nodejs console
In the actual Discord client, there's not much to do. The bot only offers 2 commands: `restart` & `info`.
However, the main feature of this bot is not in the Discord client itself, it's in the node console!

**Most people probably won't find this pratical or useful for anything, so this is really only just for fun**

# Commands
### In Discord itself
-`!help` - Shows all commands.
-`!restart` - Restarts the bot
-`!info` - Shows simple information about the bot
- + some built in Commando commands.

### In console
-`//channel <exact name or ID>` - Sets the speaking channel. This must be ran *before* you are able to speak.

# Known Issues (that probably won't be fixed)
- You can't DM users.
